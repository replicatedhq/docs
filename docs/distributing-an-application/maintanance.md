## Command Line Interface

You can use the [command line interface](/reference/replicated-cli/) to list the installed app, start and stop 
your application, get the current status, ask for updates or support bundles and more.

## Reset Console Password

If you need to reset your console password you can do so using the command line interface running as the
root user.  See our [Reseting the On-Prem Admin Password](/kb/supporting-your-customers/resetting-console-password/)
KB article.

## Automate Install

Replicated allows for [install automation](/kb/developer-resources/automate-install/),
allowing you to install TLS certificates and configure hostnames and control your 
application settings, including for LDAP integration.
