Customer field should include a brief description of your customer.

The customer field will appear as the name in the list of licenses in vendor web, and when you customer installs your application it will appear on the license page as the "License Owner".

It is a best practice to use a friendly customer name, if you have a customer ID number that you want to associate with your license we recommend adding it as a hidden license field.
