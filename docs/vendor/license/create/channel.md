The channel option determines which version of your application your customer will receive. Application updates will always use the latest promoted release in your selected channel.

For your application Replicated provides a stable, beta and unstable channel. Channels are flexible and you can add channels via the [Vendor API](/reference/vendor-api/). Normally the stable channel is used for your production releases, beta for early customer access or QA and unstable for development.

You must have a promoted release in the desired channel before you can create a license for the channel.
