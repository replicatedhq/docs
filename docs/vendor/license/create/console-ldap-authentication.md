The enable console LDAP authentication allows your customer to secure the Replicated console with their LDAP service. During the install they will be promoted to secure the onprem console and if your license allows it they can configure LDAP to authenticate with.

Replicated also provides LDAP integration APIs allowing your application to authenticate against your customers LDAP as well as provision users into your application. Learn more about the [Identity API](https://replicated.readme.io/docs/identity-api) and [Provisioning API](https://replicated.readme.io/docs/provisioning-api).
