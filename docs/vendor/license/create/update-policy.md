The update policy allows you to choose the behavior that happens when the onprem console finds there is a new release. You may choose between:

**Manual**

*The default update policy, when your app update is discovered the Replicated dashboard will present the onprem admin with an update button that will take the user to the install screen where they may perform the update.*

**Automatic**

*Automatic updates are applied when the license sync discovers your new release. You control which licenses should receive automatic updates and can determine its applicability on a customer by customer basis.*

Unless your have a specific use case that requires automatic updates it is recommended to use manual so your customers can schedule maintenance windows to perform updates.
