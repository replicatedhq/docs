To interact with the [vendor API](http://docs.replicated.com/v1.0/docs/about-the-vendor-api) 
(anything that is available in the vendor web portal is available in the API) you’ll need
 to create API tokens. This can be done from the http://vendor.replicated.com/#/team page.

This token can be used in conjunction with our API to automate most of your development and 
license issuing workflows.
