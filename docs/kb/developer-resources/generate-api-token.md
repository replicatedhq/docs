To interact with the [vendor API](/reference/vendor-api/) 
(anything that is available in the vendor web portal is available in the API) youâ€™ll need
 to create API tokens. This can be done from the http://vendor.replicated.com/#/team page.

This token can be used in conjunction with our API to automate most of your development and 
license issuing workflows.
