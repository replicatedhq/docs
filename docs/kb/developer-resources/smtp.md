Many SaaS applications rely on external email services such as SendGrid or Amazon SES to deliver 
emails. This isn't always portable to enterprise installations because these services might not 
be reachable. It's preferable to provide configuration options to let your customer configure 
their own SMTP gateway, and use that to deliver emails for on-prem installations.

There are many settings that are needed to completely configure an SMTP connection. To help, 
we've created a config snippet you can copy and paste into your YAML. This YAML snippet is at 
the bottom of this page. We also have created and included in the snippet an 
[SMTP Auth test command](/packaging-an-application/test-procs/#smtp-auth). 
This will create a test button next to the settings so that the customer can validate they've 
entered valid information.

Following this example, you'll have a settings section that looks like this:

![SMTP Configuration](/static/smtp.png)

The YAML to create this is:

```yml
- name: smtp_on

  - name: smtp_enabled
