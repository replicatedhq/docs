**This Works with Replicated Daemon 1.2.81 and above.**  

Replicated provides a way to achieve zero downtime backups by combining two of our more powerful
replicated features: [Admin Commands](/packaging-an-application/admin-commands/) and
[Snapshots](/packaging-an-application/snapshots/).

In this example we will demonstrate how to backup redis without having to stop the redis process itself:

## Step 1: Create Redis Container with 2 volumes.

**Note: This YAML creates 2 Docker volumes: 1) A primary volume (“data”) 2) a secondary volume
(“backup”) that will be used to store the redis dump. Make sure that your primary volume
(ie “data”) has `is_excluded_from_backup: true` to ensure that it isn't paused during the backup
process.**  

```yml
components:
- name: DB
  containers:
  - source: public
    image_name: redis
    version: latest
    cmd: "[\"redis-server\", \"--appendonly\", \"yes\"]"
    volumes:
    - host_path: /data
      container_path: /data:rw
      is_excluded_from_backup: true
    - host_path: /backup
      container_path: /backup
    support_files: []
```

## Step 2: Create your admin Commands to backup and move data

```yml
admin_commands:
- alias: backup-redis-to-rdb
 command:
 - redis-cli
 - bgsave
 run_type: exec
 component: DB
 image:
   image_name: redis
   version: latest
- alias: mv-backup-rdb-to-safe-place
 command:
 - mv
 - /data/dump.rdb
 - /backup/dump.rdb
 run_type: exec
 component: DB
 image:
   image_name: redis
   version: latest
```

## Step 3: Enable backups

We enable backups and inline a script that calls our admin commands (notice that we use the `--no-tty`
flag ). Note: `pause_all` is set to false thus enabling 0 downtime backups!

```yml
backup:
  enabled: true
  pause_all: false
  script: |
    #!/bin/sh
    replicated admin --no-tty backup-redis-to-rdb
    replicated admin --no-tty mv-backup-rdb-to-safe-place
```

And there you have it, zero downtime backup!
