Each Replicated installation requires customers to either use a locally generated 
self-signed TLS/SSL cert or provide their own certs during setup.

If after initial setup this needs to be changed, it can be done so from the command 
line by using the 
[SSL cert set CLI command](/reference/replicated-cli/#certificate-configuration-via-cli) 
or via the UI at https://:8800/console/settings
