**The snapshots functionality in Replicated is for disaster recovery purposes.**

Automatic snapshots by default are disabled, but if your customer has enabled snapshots they will by default run every 24 hours, see the [Snapshots documentation](/packaging-an-application/snapshots/) for information on enabling snapshots. Optionally your users can run a snapshot from the on-prem console at any time. 

To restore you need to create a fresh install of replicated which you can find instructions 
for [here](/distributing-an-application/installing/#easy-installation). Before 
running the web console at https://<server_address>:8800 place a copy of the full snapshot directory 
on the host. Proceed through the https setup screen and on the upload your license page click the 
"restore from a snapshot" link.

1. Enter the path on the host where you have copied the snapshots folder,
1. Click “Browse snapshots”:
1. Locate the latest version you would like to backup from and click the “Restore” button.

You will be given options for restoring, downloading the volumes, or deleting from the prior 
install, in this case we will restore to the local host by clicking the “restore” button.

Next you will be prompted to specify which host you would like to restore to (for this example 
I am going to restore to local).

![Restore Local Host](/static/restore-local-host.png)

The last step is to set the correct interface for the localhost, in this case it is “eth0” and one last time hit the “restore” button.

You have now restored your snapshot! Take yourself to the console.
