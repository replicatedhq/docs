It is possible to change the ui-bind-port on a running application by editing the system service files manually.

Depending on your distro, you can edit the following files:

/etc/systemd/system/replicated-ui.service or etc/init/replicated-ui.conf and restart replicated-ui using sudo service replicated-ui restart


Additionally, you can run the same install script you used during the initial installation.

curl -sSL https://get.replicated.com/docker | sudo bash -s ui-bind-port=XXXX

Replace the XXXX with the desired port.
