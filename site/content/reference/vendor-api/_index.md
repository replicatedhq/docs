The Vendor API is available for integrating Replicated into your business workflows, such as automating your continuous integration pipeline or customer license creation.


The base URL for the Vendor API is https://api.replicated.com/vendor/v1. So the API method documented as "GET /apps" will be available at https://api.replicated.com/vendor/v1/apps.
