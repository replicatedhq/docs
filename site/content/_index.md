The Replicated Docs are categorized into six hierarchical categories:

**Getting Started** - an overview of the core concepts and workflows used when integrating an application with Replicated.

**Packaging an Application** - details on creating the Replicated YAML that will drive an application's integration with Replicated features.

**Distributing an Application** - how to distribute an application to end customers and how to manage/support end customer environments.

**Examples**  - sample Replicated YAML files that leverage various features and functionality of Replicated.

**Reference**  - generated API reference documentation for the on-prem Integration API as well as the vendor facing Vendor API.

**Knowledge Base**  - a series of articles that address common questions.
